This R package has a number of dependencies that must be installed and
built before it can be installed.

First, it requires an environment variable called GIT_REPO_LOC to be
set to the location of git repositories.  For example, in your .bashrc,
put the line

export GIT_REPO_LOC="$HOME/git_repos/"

Install stan and stan math to the git repo location.

You will also need the R packages Rcpp and RcppEigen and devtools.

Change to the subdirectory MicrocreditLRVB/inst/microcredit_cpp/src and
run cmake then make install:

cd $GIT_REPO_LOC/MicrocreditLRVB/inst/microcredit_cpp/src
cmake .
sudo make install

Then install the R package:
cd $GIT_REPO_LOC
R -e 'library(devtools); install_local("MicrocreditLRVB")'
