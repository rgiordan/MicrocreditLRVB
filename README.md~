This R package has a number of C++ dependencies that must be installed and
built before it can be installed.

First, it requires an environment variable called GIT_REPO_LOC to be
set to the location of git repositories.  For example, in your .bashrc,
put the line

export GIT_REPO_LOC="$HOME/git_repos/"

Install stan, stan math, and LinearResponseVariationalBayes.cpp to the git
repo location.

https://github.com/stan-dev/stan
https://github.com/stan-dev/math
https://github.com/rgiordan/LinearResponseVariationalBayes.cpp

Follow the instructions to build the libraries in
LinearResponseVariationalBayes.cpp.

You will also need the R packages Rcpp and RcppEigen and devtools.  In R:

install.packages("devtools")
install.packages("Rcpp")
install.packages("RcppEigen")

Next you must install the C++ libraries in this repository.  Check out this
repository, change to the subdirectory MicrocreditLRVB/inst/microcredit_cpp/src and
run cmake then make install:

cd $GIT_REPO_LOC/MicrocreditLRVB/inst/microcredit_cpp/src
cmake .
sudo make install

Then install the R package:
cd $GIT_REPO_LOC
R -e 'library(devtools); install_local("MicrocreditLRVB")'

To run the example, first run the stan code:
inst/R/microcredit_stan_analysis.R

This is slow, and will save a re-usable datafile.  Then run the LRVB part:
inst/R/microcredit_data_analysis.R
